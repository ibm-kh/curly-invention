    "As you continue to sharpen your Python skills and get more and more comfortable writing programs, you'll eventually become really good at reading code. Just by looking at a line or two you'll be able to tell what the program is doing, and what's going to happen.\n",

    "But, in a lot of cases, merely relying on the code to properly explain or document itself can be ineffective, and often times in the course of writing a program you'll want to mark things down or explain why you're doing things a certain way. This is where comments can be your best friend.\n",

    "These single line comments are also often used to describe or give more context to a line of code. As a general rule it's always preferred that you write clear, descriptive code so that comments like this aren't necessary, but every once in a while a well placed comment can clear up confusion.\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally a comment like the one described above, is placed either directly above the line of code it's describing, or immediately to the right of it. I always prefer to put these types of comments on top of the line of code because otherwise you'll find that one single line of code ends up being really long, which can get annoying.\n",

    "There are no hard set rules for when you should and shouldn’t use comments when writing programs. In a lot of cases it’s just personal preference.\n",

If you’re looking at a line of code, and can’t tell what it’s doing without reading a corresponding comment, then, except for in rare cases, that line of code can probably be re-written.\n",

As you write more and more complex programs, a lot of times you’ll run into problems where the code is crashing at certain points. In cases like this, I will generally comment out, that is to say, surround with comments, the code I think is causing the problem, and if the code starts working again then I’ve found the culprit."
