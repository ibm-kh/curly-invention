    "Computers and numbers are like bread and butter. In fact the term computer actually used to refer to people who's job it was to do calculations and \"compute\" things all day. Needless to say we've come a long way since then, and modern computers are capable of performing billions of calculations in the time it takes a normal human to even write a number down.\n",

    "Not to nerd out here too much, but when you get down to it, all computer instructions, all the code that we've written in this course, and all the code that's currently running on your computer, is actually just a collection of complex patterns of 0s & 1s running through your processor. And that same processor that's running everything on your computer is made up of a bunch of ALUs which stands for Arithmetic Logic Unit, basically a digital circuit which does basic math really really fast!\n",

    "The first thing I'd like to discuss is a very fundamental concept which is integral to mathematics as well as computer programming, which is the difference between an integer and a float.\n",
    "\n",
    "These are two different types of numbers that we can work with in our programs, and it's important that you have a grasp of the differences so you can use them appropriately.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start with integers which are whole numbers, or counting numbers. That means both negative numbers, positive numbers and zero, as long as they don't have decimal places after them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Integers are often used to store thing that can't be broken up, like the number of minutes in the hour (you wouldn't say it 10:42.5). They can also be used for counting the number of times something has happened. This in particular will come in handy when we look at loops later on in this course.\n",
    "Unlike integers, floats are any numbers with decimal places. Even if a float is technically a whole number like 42, in order for it to be a float it would have to have a .0 at the end of it 42.0.\n",
    "\n",
    "Floats are often used when precision is a factor, like in scientific measurements, or in many cases when representing percentages (0.0 - 1.0).\n",
    "Any time you're working with numbers in your programs, you always want to be aware of the type of number you're using, be it an integer or a float. Failure to do say may result in aspects of your program not performing as intended, or math calculations not giving precise enough answers."
