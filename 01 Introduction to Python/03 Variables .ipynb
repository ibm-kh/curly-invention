    "\n",
    "Often times when you're writing a program in Python, there will be several pieces of data that you need to keep track of. Just like you're constantly keeping track of different pieces of information as you go about your day, like what you have to do at work, or when you're going to the gym, or what the name of the person who just moved in across the hall is, computers also need to keep track of various pieces of information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think for example of Facebook. Facebook keeps track of tons of information and displays it on their websites and apps. Things like names, birthdays, status', etc. In order for us to write more complex programs like these, that do more than print text out onto the screen, we'll need to learn how to manage all of the information in our programs and use variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Variables are essentially containers which allow a program to store different pieces of information inside of them. Once the information is stored inside the variable, that information can then be accessed throughout the program simply by referring to the variable's name.\n",

Well in order to do that we would have to look through all of the code we wrote, and find every place where we wrote the name George and individually change it to the new name (hoping we didn't make any spelling mistake along the way).\n",
