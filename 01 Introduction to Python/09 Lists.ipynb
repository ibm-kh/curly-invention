    "Up until this point in the course, we've been working with different types of data, and generally we've been using variables to store that data. Variables are great because we can take pieces of data that would otherwise be difficult to remember and keep track of and store them in a nice, named container.\n",

    "\n",
    "When you have lots of data like this that's meant to be grouped together, you can't use normal variables to store it. If you did you would need to create hundreds or thousands of variables, and that's assuming that you even know how many pieces of data would be in the collection.\n",
    "\n",
    "Luckily for us the problem of storing large amounts of data like this has been solved with something called an array.\n",
